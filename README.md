# ColoRandom# Colorandom 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
We built and application for users to select a palette of color of their choosing. A palette of five colors is displayed when the page loads. 
If the user likes the page, they can press a "save palette" button and that palette will be saved to the right section of the page. If the user wants 
to see another random selection of colors, they can press the "new palette" button and a five random colors will appear in the main section of the page. 
The user can also lock and unlock individual colors of the main palette displayed on the page so that they can save colors within the pallet and continue 
refreshing the unlocked colors.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
Open up the terminal and past the SSH code after typing git clone in the terminal. Next enter the repesitory with the cd command. Then type code . and the
code will come up in the text editer. Then in the terminal type open index.html and the application will open in the browser.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
We stuck to our schedule from beginning to end. We worked during the scheduled work time that Turing provided on the schedule. After school we worked from 
5pm-8pm MT. We worked for the whole day on Saturday and most of the day on Sunday. We came in at approximately 38 hours.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
Our goal for this project was to find a good workflow in a team project. We also wanted to use all of our strengths up to this point to accomplish the tech goals that 
were required to complete the project. In our javascript we used global variables, helper functions and, methods to accomplish the functionality goal of the page. 
We worked on fine tuning our CSS and HTML skills to get the proper layout of the page. Our understanding of manipulating the children of the parent elements improved
a lot through this chalenge.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
We stayed very organized and focused thanks to the norms and the Trello board that we had set up at on day one. Another win was that we built our functions
with the help of pseudocoding and brainstorming together. We all had different strengths that we brought to the table and it made the group dynamic more productive.
It took us a long time to build each function but we were resourceful using MDN and W3 schools for help to get us in the right direction. We reached out for help from 
our rocks, mentors and classmates when we were stuck, and in the end we were all able to understand the code we wound up with.
